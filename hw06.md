a. cpu :      
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions       
b. ram :    
Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.      
c. rom :     
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices.      
d. Bus (computing)     
In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.      
e. Parallel Computing     
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.[1] Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.     
并行计算（英语：parallel computing）一般是指许多指令得以同时进行的计算模式。在同时进行的前提下，可以将计算的过程分解成小部分，之后以并发方式来加以解决
