let’s introduce Venture Capital(captured from Wikipedia):

Venture capital (VC) is a type of private equity, a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small, early-stage, emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential, or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, or both). Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake, in the companies they invest in. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful.Because startups face high uncertainty, VC investment do have high rates of failure. The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries, such as information technology (IT), clean technology or biotechnology.

When we talk about the those world-famous companies,we may come up with names like Apple,Google,Oracle,Cisco,Yahoo,Linkedln and so on.
To tell the truth,there is a huge company behind them.
Who is so powerful to father those World-Wide-Known companies?To be honest,as for me,if only I have one to manage,I would have no worries about my pocket!Let’s move on to see!

Step inside Sequoia’s spartan offices at Silicon Valley’s capital of capital, Sand Hill Road, and see what happens when a handful of hungry perfectionists like Leone band together. Start at the entryway, packed with framed copies of financing documents for 98 companies. The hit parade begins with Apple’s initial public offering in 1980; it includes the likes of Oracle, Cisco, Yahoo, Google and LinkedIn. These are Sequoia’s children. Since its founding in 1972 Sequoia has backed startups that now command a staggering $1.4 trillion of combined stock market value, equivalent to 22% of Nasdaq.

Yet Sequoia doesn’t display its heritage with the well-heeled pride you might find at other top-tier venture firms, let alone the likes of JPMorgan or KKR. At Sequoia the historic IPO filings are crammed into drab, drugstore-quality frames. Sequoia partners don’t enjoy luxurious private offices; instead they toil at stand-up desks in a big open hall. Conference rooms are adorned with cheap plastic wastebaskets. It’s as if Sequoia’s partners haven’t fully realized that they might be rich.

We might assume that Sequoia Capital is luck enough to have such American creative mind to make money for them.Yet it not only focus on Silicon Valley,but also China,India and Israel.Sequoia connecting with entrepreneurs born in Ukraine, Ireland, Finland, Greece, India, Pakistan, Venezuela and a dozen other countries. (By contrast, Kauffman Foundation data show that barely a quarter of all U.S. startups have at least one immigrant cofounder.)

Its branch in China is called Sequoia China,which is executed by Shen Nanpeng,who won the Champion of China Information Technology Organization when he was just a 15-year-old child.

Graduated from Yale University(MA) and SJTU(BS),also known as Neil, Shen is a Co-Founder and Head of Sequoia Capital China and has been its Founding Managing Partner since 2005 and serves as its Global Managing Partner. Mr. Shen is the Founding Managing Partner of Shanghai Channel Media Advertisement Co., Ltd. He is a Co-Founder of Zhenge Fund and serves as its Managing Partner and Global Managing Partner. He serves as Independent Director at Pinduoduo Inc. He serves as a Non Executive Director at China.

JD,58,ZTO Express,Meituan,DiDi,Dajiang,Pinduoduo,these companies have one thing in common,invested by Sequoia Capital.You may say that they have enough money to invest every new-born Unicorn,but their accuracy is also very high,here is the evidence: 13 super Unicorns were born after 2010,such as JD,Pinduoduo and so on,they have accurately invested 10 in 13!

The theory by Shen Nanpeng,also known as Race Track Theory,says that which you should invest your money does not depend on the person you are facing but the right area.

As for an example:
Meraki,which is founded by two students who were fresh from MIT,was just a working product and proprietary technology,but no business model.
One founder of Meraki ,Sanjit Biswas,said,“Sequoia viewed us through the lens of markets and said, “That doesn’t seem like a big business today — but it’s clear people are going to need networks. We’re just going to have to experiment to find our way through this.””
And…
In 2009, newly focused on the enterprise networking market, Meraki hit its stride. The company was acquired by Cisco in November 2012, with all three co-founders active in leading roles. By the end of Meraki’s independent run, the company sales were at a $120M run rate, with half coming from the enterprise.

This is only a len to show Venture Capital,the further research needs more time, .In the end,thanks for reading!
